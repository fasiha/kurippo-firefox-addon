# Kurippo Firefox Add-on
[Kurippo・クリッポ](https://github.com/fasiha/kurippo) is a personal web clipper which features
- URL, title, and selection saving,
- SSL/HTTPS login via Github,
- this fancy Firefox add-on instead of a bookmarklet, because although bookmarklets should be exempt from [Content Security Policy](https://github.com/blog/1477-content-security-policy) (CSP), no browser respects this. With this add-on, you can clip away on GitHub, Medium, and other sites that use CSP without disabling it.

Mainly it's a technology demonstration using `jpm`.
